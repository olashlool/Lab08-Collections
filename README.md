# Lab08-Collections
Create and utilize generic collections. Created a library! Users are given multiple choices of ways to 
interact with the library. This meant creating classes for Books and the Library. 
Collections came into play when a user either adds or removes a book from their book bag. 
Users are also able to create new books, and view all the books within the library and the books in their bags!
